### Workshop Title: Build, Fine-tune, and Deploy Generative AI Applications on AWS


### Workshop Description

This hands-on workshop gives attendees an opportunity to experience how
quickly and easily theyâ€™ll be able to experiment with a number of leading LLMs, build RAG-based
applications, fine-tune LLMs to leverage domain specific corpus, and deploy LLMs in a cost-effective
way. AWS AI/ML Specialists and SAs will showcase accessing cutting-edge models including
Anthropic Claude3, Mistral/ Mixtral, Meta Llama with text and image multi-modal capabilities.
Through hands-on experience on financial services use case examples, attendees will enjoy the
easiness of using Amazon Bedrock to rapidly build robust generative AI applications and leverage the
